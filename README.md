# Russian news stream event detection

The work is dedicated to the development of a method for Russian news stream event detection. ”Event” is a group of news dedicated to one real-world event. A streaming clustering model aggregates the similarity between documents and clusters by their combination of sparse and dense representations and, using machine learning methods, makes a decision to define each subsequent news either in the most news-like story, or in a new one. The labeled news dataset in Russian shows that the proposed method surpasses existing solutions in terms of the external clustering metrics.
